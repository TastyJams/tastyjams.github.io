  Hello perspective CITs!
</h3>
<p class="yes">
  Becoming a summer camp counselor in training can be an arduous task. A student must know where to go and what to do. My goal as a veteran CIT is to help that student survive the hardships of unpaid camp work.
</p>
<h3 class="header">Rule One: Set rules from the start </h3>

<p class="yes">
  Children push so they can find boundaries. If you set your boundaries early, the children won’t push as much. Without borders, you will be tormented constanty.
</p>
<h3 class="header">Rule 2: Be social</h3>

<p class="yes">
  While it is important for a CIT’s kids to respect him, it is equally important for the kids to feel comfortable around him. Kids will not open up to a walking rulebook, so socialize.
</p>
<h3 class="header">
  Rule 3: Understand that the counselors own you
</h3>

<p class="yes">
  To not go insane during one’s time as a CIT, they must understand that counselors own them. As a CIT, you have no real power, and the only way to get through it is the understanding that one day, you will be a counselor, bossing around your own CITs.

  Thanks for Listening!

  With my advice heard and considered, I hope all perspective CITs have fun at camp.
